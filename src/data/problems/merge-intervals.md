# Merge Intervals

Given an array of intervals where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

```python
def merge(intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
    return merged
```

### Complexity

- Time: O(n log n) due to sort
- Space: O(n)
