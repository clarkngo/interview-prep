# Word Search II

Given an m x n board and a list of strings words, return all words on the board.

Example

```
Input: board = [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]], words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
Output: ["oath","eat"]
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findWords(self, board: List[List[str]], words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        # Typical solution builds a trie of words and DFS on board
        pass
```
